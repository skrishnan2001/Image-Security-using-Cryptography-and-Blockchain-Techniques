# Image-Security-using-Cryptography-and-Blockchain-Techniques
A project aimed to prevent malicious attacks on images, primarily using cryptographic techniques and blockchain based image authentication schemes

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop an application that allows for the secure sharing of images over a network while ensuring the confidentiality, authentication and integrity of the images being shared, through the use of cryptographic techniques and a merkle tree based image authentication scheme.

- <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Achieved by encrypting the image using substitution and transposition techniques using the symmetric key generated by the cryptographic chaos functions. 
- <strong>User Authentication</strong>: Since symmetric keys are being used, only the sender and the corresponding receiver will have access to the key, thereby ensuring the image is sent from the perfect sender.
- <strong>Integrity</strong>: A merkle tree based approach is proposed to ensure that the integrity of the image is being preserved.
